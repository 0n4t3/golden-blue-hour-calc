# Golden & Blue Hour Calculator
A super simple site/PWA that calculates Golden Hour and Blue Hour for your given location. It's a static site, all calculations are performed locally and it'll work offline if you install it as a PWA.

I made this mostly for myself, the freemium golden hour calculator app I was using in the past started refusing to work since I don't have Google Play service on my phone. That, and I got a free Gemini Pro trial to try out vibe coding, so I might as well burn as many tokens as I can before it runs out.
